- Add Discrete Math Cheatsheet to site

- Graph basics
    - Vertex, Edges
    - Vertex "degree" is how many edges are attached to vertex
    - Even and odd degrees, 3 edges to vertex is odd, 2 is even, etc.
- Add Walk, Trail, Path, and Circuit Information
    - Include Closed Walk and Simple Circuit
- Euler's Circuit
    - All edges must be used exactly once
    - Possible if every vertex has an even degree
